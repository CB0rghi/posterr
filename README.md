### Tests
The project was built using Jest and React TestingLibrary.  
My goal was to use TDD on the entire project but due the time restrictions it was not possible, so I wrote a few ones, in a real life project, I would have asked for more time to use TDD all the way.

To run the tests, execute:
  ```
  yarn test
  ```
